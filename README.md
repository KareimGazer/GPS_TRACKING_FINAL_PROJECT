# GPS Tracker 
Interfaced GPS module with Tiva-C ARM microcontroller via UART that computes user's path and store it in EEPROM.
The device gets connected to the PC and data is collected from the virtual port using Python Serial Lib.
The userâ€™s path is displayed and compared against other apps.

**Utilized:**
- Ublox NEO GPS module
- Tiva-C ARM Cortex-M microcontroller
- C/C++
- Python
- GPIO
- UART
- EEPROM
- JTAG/SWD Debugging Interface
